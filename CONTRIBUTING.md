## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and new requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase and we actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make the changes.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!
